# Node.js Passport Password Reset Example

This is a working version of the work described the blog post
[How To Implement Password Reset In Node.js by Sahat Yalkabov](http://sahatyalkabov.com/how-to-implement-password-reset-in-nodejs/)

* This is not my creation. Credit should go to Sahat Yalkabov for creating an excellent tutorial.
* I have followed the blog post and used current (Oct 2017) versions of libraries
* The code has been updated to fix syntax errors due to changes in libraries
* Library versions have been explicitly set to prevent similar syntax errors in the future due to library changes
